                        We are a professional multi-species livestock marketing and frozen food company owned by farmers. We offer veterinary and consulting services for farmers as well as sell livestock throughout Nigeria and invest for those who want to own livestock but lack the time to keep track of it. <br /> <br />

                        Since our founding three years ago, we have built a trustworthy network of more than 4,000 Nigerian farmers across the country. Through these connections, we facilitate livestock trade along the whole Nigerian supply chain, from the breeder to the processor.<br /> <br />

                        We are a trusted partner to our clients because of this experience.
